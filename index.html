                <p>I took on the Tech Up 3.0 challenge, and I have to admit, it feels pretty meaningful to have actually come out on the other side with something I’m genuinely proud of.</p>
                
                <p>To be honest, I never thought I’d be able to do this again. The last time I touched coding was 20 years ago, and let’s just say, I wasn’t exactly acing it back then. So when I first heard about this program, I’ll admit—my first thought was, 'Is my boss trying to get rid of me?' (Ha!) He didn’t know about my epic struggles with programming back in the day, but those old fears and doubts definitely resurfaced.</p>
                
                <p>That said, after going through this journey—with a lot of help from Google and some trusty AI tools—I’ve realized that programming isn’t as overwhelming as it used to be. There are so many tools now that can correct your code in real-time, so you don’t have to worry about asking for help and fearing someone will judge your skills (not that anyone here would, of course!).</p>
                
                <p>So, if I can do it, I’m convinced anyone can. Whether you’ve never touched code before or, like me, you’ve failed programming in the past, this is proof that it’s never too late to jump in and give it a shot. Right now, I’m genuinely grateful for the opportunity to take on this challenge.</p>
            
                <p>Would love to hear from you about your experiences too! <a href="mailto:yvonnetyr@yahoo.com.au" class="email-link">Email Me</a></p>
